# Warning
Don't use this yet. The pkg recipe is not working.

To do:
- [ ] the pkg only needs to deliver the `fleetctl` binary, not CHANGELOG.md, LICENSE, or other files included in the zip
- [ ] the pkg is not yet working due to SIP. ultimately want to deliver the binary to a location that is automatically included in $PATH
